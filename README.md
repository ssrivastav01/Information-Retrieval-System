The project is grounded in several key theoretical concepts from the field of information retrieval:

**Web Crawling:** The project employs a web crawler to systematically navigate a target website, following links and collecting relevant data. This process is guided by theoretical principles such as graph traversal algorithms (e.g., breadth-first or depth-first search) and considerations for respecting website policies (robots.txt) and ethical crawling practices.

**Text Processing and Normalization:** Before data can be indexed, it undergoes preprocessing steps like tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of punctuation and stop words. These steps are based on linguistic and statistical principles to standardize the text and improve search accuracy.

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** This numerical statistic is a cornerstone of information retrieval. It quantifies the importance of a term within a document relative to a collection of documents. The project likely utilizes TF-IDF to weight terms in the index, reflecting their significance for search relevance.

**Inverted Index:** The inverted index is a fundamental data structure in information retrieval. It maps terms to the documents in which they appear, along with their associated weights (e.g., TF-IDF scores). This structure enables efficient retrieval of documents containing specific terms.

**Cosine Similarity:** This metric is used to measure the similarity between the query vector (representing the user's search terms) and document vectors (representing the content of each document). Cosine similarity is based on the angle between vectors in a high-dimensional space, with a higher similarity indicating greater relevance.

**Practical Implementation**
The project translates these theoretical concepts into a practical implementation using a combination of tools and technologies:

Scrapy: This Python framework is employed for web crawling, providing a structured way to define spiders that navigate websites and extract data.

Scikit-Learn: This machine learning library offers tools for text processing (TfidfVectorizer) and calculating TF-IDF scores, which are essential for building the inverted index.

Flask: This lightweight web framework is used to create the user interface, handling search queries and presenting results in a web browser.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): This library might be used for additional text processing tasks, such as stemming or lemmatization, to further refine the search process.

**System Architecture**
The project's architecture is modular, with distinct components for crawling, indexing, and processing. This modularity enhances maintainability and allows for potential future enhancements. The components interact through well-defined interfaces, primarily using JSON for data exchange and pickle for index serialization.
